When users first enter the website, they are greeted with the current date. The page is structured as follows:
## Heder
In the header, my name appears on the left corner, while on the right side there are navigation buttons to move around the page, along with an extra button that links to my LinkedIn profile. The layout was achieved using Flexbox to push the buttons to the right.
## about me 
This section includes a profile photo along with an introduction about me, where I study, my major, and my interests
## projucts
Here I used the box model, and each box contains a title, description, and image. I applied a flex-wrap property so that the boxes adjust responsively and do not disappear when the page size becomes smaller
## contact 
This section includes a form with fields such as name, email, and message, along with a submit button. I placed everything inside a container to make the design look cleaner and more organized.

## Future Advancements
In the future, I hope to add more JavaScript functionalities, include CSS-based animations and interactive designs, and expand the site with additional sections such as languages I have learned.
